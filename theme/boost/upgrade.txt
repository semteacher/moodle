=== 3.5 ===

The Boost theme now uses Bootstrap 4 Stable (BS4S).

We are trying to use as much BS4S classes in MDL Templates to reduce the amount of Moodle CSS.

The biggest changes are:

JavaScript
----------
* All Bootstrap javascript has been updated.

Sass
----
* A number of variables are no longer available in Bootstrap 4 Stable. For now a bs4alpha compatibility file has been added, see scss/bs4alphacompat.scss which translates veriable names from the Alpha version to the stable version.

* m-t-* and other spacing utilities should be replaced with mt-*.

The units that were used for margins have changed too
m-t-1 is now mt-3
m-t-2 is now mt-4
m-t-3 is now mt-5


Grid and Flexbox
----------------
The Boostrap grid uses CSS's flexbox grid to build layouts.

New breakpoints for grids have been added:
.col-*  <576px
.col-sm-* >= 576px
.col-md-* >= 768px
.col-lg-* >= 992px
.col-xl-* >= 1200px

All usage of '*-xs-*' have been dropped. So what used to be col-xs-6 should now be written as col-6.

*-md-* has become *-lg-*, and *-lg-* has become *-xl-*.

Typography
----------
Boostrap 4 uses the browser default font size. A setting has been added to boost to set the relative fontsize.

Presets
-------
The usage of preset files has been removed. The theme still supports adding SASS variables and SASS logic in the advanced setting tab on the theme boost settings page. The Raw initial SCSS field is for sass variables, everything else that should be added after Bootstrap SASS should go to the Raw SCSS field. If you are looking for something more permanent you can add a bootswatch folder in scc/bootswatch/dist.

Bootswatches
------------
Bootswatches have been added, they should still be considered experimental, however, the aim is to make sure Boost works with bootswatches. Using the default Bootswatch is recommended. Dark coloured Bootswatches could cause issues.

Changed Components
------------------
Cards need this structure
 class='card'
    class='card-body'
This used to be 'card-block'

The header.mustache template has been replace by a navbar.mustache template for name consistancy with Bootstrap

A new header.mustache template has been created served from core/core_renderer.php. This should be move to core at some point.


=== 3.4 ===
* For improved accessibility, the footer links for boost have been changed to use $bg-inverse-link-color (defaults to white) and
  now have an underline text-decoration. To override the link colour simply set $bg-inverse-link-color in your preset file or
  theme scss.
* To match the new primary colour we are switching to using the UX pallette, which uses a purple colour for info. To override,
  set $brand-info in your preset file or theme scss.
